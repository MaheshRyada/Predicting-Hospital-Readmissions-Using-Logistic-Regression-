# 🏥 Logistic Regression Model for Hospital Readmission

This repository contains a logistic regression model developed to predict hospital readmissions based on patient data. The goal is to help healthcare providers identify at-risk patients and take proactive measures.

## 📌 Project Overview

Hospital readmissions are a significant burden on healthcare systems. By using logistic regression, this project aims to predict the probability of a patient being readmitted, allowing for timely interventions.
